Sentence: According to Reuters, Pakistan’s Support for Taliban Boomerangs on Islamabad, as Refugees Pour Out of Afghanistan An investigation into human rights abuses is urgently needed. Pakistan’s support of the Taliban is boomeranging, as a growing Pashtun population demands rights that Islamabad has long denied them. Tensions are rising as the Pashtuns, fleeing Taliban tyranny in Afghanistan, have been crossing into their eastern neighbor, where they historically constitute a beleaguered minority in contrast with the majority Punjabis.

Some steps have been taken to address certain grievances, but the PTM leadership is facing increasing pressure and intimidation. The situation escalated to a point where several PTM leaders have been arrested on charges of sedition and terrorism. Domestic and international human rights organizations criticized the arrests, amid other reports of torture and disappearances of PTM activists. Non-governmental organizations like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have expressed concerns over the treatment of PTM leaders and activists. This has erupted after the arrest of two activists, Eid-U-Rahman and Gilaman Wazir. A prominent PTM leader, Ali Wazir,
